# Enterprise Departmental Billing - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We Built

Your Records Management system now supports **enterprise-level departmental billing** with complete flexibility for companies with many departments.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Question You Asked

> "What if they have 45 departments? Can there be a breakdown by department with one invoice number? Or what if they choose to have each department billed individually with 45 separate invoice numbers?"

## âœ… The Answer: YES to Both!

### Scenario 1: Consolidated Billing (45 Departments â†’ 1 Invoice)
- **One invoice** with detailed department breakdown
- **45 department sections** with subtotals  
- **Single invoice number** for easy accounting
- **Internal cost allocation** clearly visible

### Scenario 2: Separate Billing (45 Departments â†’ 45 Invoices)
- **45 individual invoices** with unique invoice numbers
- **Department-specific billing contacts** 
- **Separate PO numbers** per department
- **Independent payment processing**

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Billing (Best of Both)
- **Storage consolidated** (1 invoice for all storage costs)
- **Services separate** (individual invoices per department for services)

## ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Billing Preferences
```python
billing_preference = fields.Selection([
    ('consolidated', 'Consolidated - One invoice with department breakdown'),
    ('separate', 'Separate - Individual invoices per department'),
    ('hybrid', 'Hybrid - Consolidated storage, separate services'),
])
```

### 2. Department Billing Contacts
- Each department can have its own billing contact
- Separate email addresses for invoice delivery
- Department-specific PO numbers
- Flexible contact management

### 3. Enhanced Billing Calculation
- Department-level cost tracking
- Proportional minimum fee distribution
- Per-department or company-wide minimums
- Automatic invoice generation

### 4. Advanced Invoice Generation
- **Consolidated**: One invoice with department sections and subtotals
- **Separate**: Individual invoices with department-specific contacts
- **Hybrid**: Mixed approach for complex billing needs
