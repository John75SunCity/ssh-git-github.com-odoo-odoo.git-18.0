## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Models:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system.diagram.data (Data aggregator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system.flowchart.wizard (Configuration wizard)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JavaScript Components:
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SystemFlowchartView (Main view)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SystemFlowchartController (User interactions)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SystemFlowchartRenderer (Visualization)
```

### Dependencies
- **vis.js Network**: Network visualization library
- **Odoo Web Framework**: Base web components
- **Records Management Security**: Access control integration

### Data Sources
- **ir.model**: System models and relationships
- **res.users/res.groups**: User and security information
- **res.company**: Company and department structure
- **ir.model.access**: Access control rules
- **Records Management Models**: Business data relationships

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only users with Records Management access can view the flowchart
- Sensitive information is filtered based on user permissions
- Department-level data separation is enforced
- Portal users see limited, relevant information only

### Privacy Features
- Personal information is anonymized where appropriate
- Access patterns are aggregated for privacy
- Compliance with data protection regulations
- Audit logging of flowchart access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### **Diagram Not Loading**
- Check browser JavaScript console for errors
- Verify vis.js library is properly loaded
- Ensure user has appropriate permissions

#### **Search Not Working**
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify search query syntax
- Check if target objects exist in system

#### **Export Failures**
- Ensure browser supports canvas export
- Check popup blocker settings
- Verify sufficient browser memory

#### **Access Rights Not Showing**
- Confirm user has security audit permissions
- Verify access rules are properly configured
- Check if target models are accessible

### Performance Optimization
- Large systems: Use search filters to limit displayed nodes
- Slow rendering: Disable physics simulation in network layout
- Memory issues: Export specific sections rather than full diagram
