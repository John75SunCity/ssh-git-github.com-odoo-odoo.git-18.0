# Comprehensive Dual Billing System - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**

Your sophisticated billing system is now fully implemented to handle the complex dual billing model:

### **Business Model Summary**
- **Storage Fees**: Billed forward (in advance) with flexible cycles (monthly/quarterly/annual/prepaid)
- **Service Fees**: Always billed in arrears (after completion) regardless of storage billing cycle
- **Combined Invoicing**: Single invoice containing both forward storage charges and backward service charges

## ðŸ“‹ **System Architecture**

### **Core Models Implemented**

#### 1. **Customer Billing Profile** (`records.customer.billing.profile`)
**Purpose**: Configure individual customer billing preferences and cycles

**Key Features**:
- **Storage Billing Cycles**: Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, Annual, or Prepaid
- **Service Billing Cycles**: Monthly, Weekly, or Immediate upon completion
- **Advance/Arrears Configuration**: Storage typically advance, services always arrears
- **Prepaid Support**: Customers can prepay storage for custom periods with discounts
- **Auto-billing Settings**: Separate automation for storage vs service billing
- **Multiple Billing Contacts**: Different contacts for different invoice types

#### 2. **Advanced Billing Period** (`records.advanced.billing.period`)
**Purpose**: Manage individual billing periods with dual timing support

**Key Features**:
- **Dual Period Support**: Different date ranges for storage (forward) vs services (backward)
- **Billing Type**: Storage-only, Service-only, or Combined
- **Automatic Line Generation**: Smart generation of storage and service charges
- **Invoice Integration**: Direct integration with Odoo accounting
- **Status Tracking**: Draft â†’ Confirmed â†’ Invoiced â†’ Paid workflow

#### 3. **Enhanced Billing Lines** (`records.billing.line`)
**Purpose**: Individual line items with advanced categorization

**Key Features**:
- **Line Type Distinction**: Storage vs Service line identification
- **Billing Direction**: Advance vs Arrears automatic determination
- **Multiple Work Order References**: Links to retrieval and shredding orders
- **Period-Specific Dating**: Service dates vs billing periods clearly distinguished

#### 4. **Billing Automation Service** (`records.billing.service`)
**Purpose**: Automated billing generation and management

**Key Features**:
- **Monthly Automation**: Automatically generate all customer billing
- **Quarterly Support**: Special handling for quarterly storage customers
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Smart detection of already-billed items
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error management

## ðŸ’° **Billing Examples**

### **Example 1: Monthly Storage + Monthly Service Customer**

**Configuration**:
- Storage Billing: Monthly in advance
- Service Billing: Monthly in arrears
- Invoice Date: August 1st

**August 1st Invoice Contains**:
- **Storage Charges**: August 1-31 (billed forward)
- **Service Charges**: July 1-31 completed work orders (billed in arrears)

### **Example 2: Quarterly Storage + Monthly Service Customer**

**Configuration**:
- Storage Billing: Quarterly in advance
- Service Billing: Monthly in arrears
- Invoice Date: August 1st

**August 1st Invoice Contains**:
- **Storage Charges**: August 1 - October 31 (3 months forward)
- **Service Charges**: July 1-31 completed work orders (1 month arrears)

**September 1st Invoice Contains**:
- **Storage Charges**: None (already paid through October)
- **Service Charges**: August 1-31 completed work orders (1 month arrears)

### **Example 3: Prepaid Storage Customer**

**Configuration**:
- Storage Billing: Prepaid 12 months with 5% discount
- Service Billing: Monthly in arrears
- Prepaid Payment: January 1st for full year

**Monthly Invoices (Feb-Dec) Contain**:
- **Storage Charges**: None (prepaid balance consumed)
- **Service Charges**: Previous month's completed work orders only

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Features**

### **Smart Billing Logic**

#### **Storage Billing (Forward)**
```python
# Example: August 1st invoice for monthly customer
start_date = invoice_date.replace(day=1)  # August 1
end_date = start_date + relativedelta(months=1) - timedelta(days=1)  # August 31

# For quarterly customers
end_date = start_date + relativedelta(months=3) - timedelta(days=1)  # October 31
```

#### **Service Billing (Arrears)**
```python
# Example: August 1st invoice billing July services
end_date = invoice_date.replace(day=1) - timedelta(days=1)  # July 31
start_date = end_date.replace(day=1)  # July 1
```

### **Automated Generation**

#### **Monthly Cron Job**
- Processes all active billing profiles
- Generates storage billing for customers due for billing
- Generates service billing for customers with completed work orders
- Prevents duplicate billing through smart detection

#### **Work Order Integration**
- **Document Retrieval Orders**: Automatically included in service billing upon completion
- **Shredding Work Orders**: Both external and managed inventory destruction included
- **Completion Tracking**: Only completed orders are billed
