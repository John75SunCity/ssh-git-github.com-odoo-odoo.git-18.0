             PORTAL HOME MENU TEMPLATE - DISABLED IN v18.0.1.0.25
             ===================================================================
             
             REASON FOR DISABLING:
             This template previously added 10 static hardcoded cards to the portal home:
             - Physical Inventory
             - Service Requests
             - Destruction & Compliance
             - Billing & Invoices
             - Reports & Analytics
             - Tools & Utilities
             - Advanced Inventory
             - Barcode Operations (SECURITY VIOLATION)
             - User Management
             - Feedback & Communication
             
             PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
             1. DUPLICATE CARDS: portal_home_preconfigured.xml already renders
                dynamic cards built by the controller (PORTAL_CARD_METADATA in main.py)
             
             2. SECURITY VIOLATIONS:
                - Barcode Scanner link in "Tools & Utilities" card
                - Entire "Barcode Operations" card with 4 barcode scanner links
                - Both were accessible to ALL portal users (should be internal only)
                - Contradicts security policy from v18.0.1.0.18
             
             3. MAINTENANCE ISSUES:
                - Static hardcoded cards cannot be configured dynamically
                - No integration with RM Module Configurator
                - No real-time counts or data
                - Changes require template editing instead of controller config
             
             REPLACEMENT:
             Use portal_home_preconfigured.xml which renders dynamic cards from
             controller.PORTAL_CARD_METADATA. These dynamic cards:
             - Are configured centrally in the controller
             - Can be extended without editing templates
             - Respect RM Module Configurator settings
             - Provide real-time counts and data
             - Have proper security group restrictions
             
             TEMPLATE STATUS: Completely removed
             ALTERNATIVE: portal_home_preconfigured.xml + PORTAL_CARD_METADATA
             VERSION: Disabled in v18.0.1.0.25
