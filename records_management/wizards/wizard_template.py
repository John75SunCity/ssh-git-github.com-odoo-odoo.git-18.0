    This is a template for creating new wizards. Wizards are temporary models
    used for interactive user dialogs. They do not store data permanently.

    To use this template:
    1. Copy this file to a new file in the 'wizards' directory (e.g., my_wizard.py).
    2. Rename the class (e.g., MyWizard).
    3. Change the _name (e.g., 'my.wizard').
    4. Add the necessary fields for your wizard's logic.
    5. Implement the logic in the action method.
    6. Create a corresponding view file in 'views/' (e.g., my_wizard_views.xml).
    7. Create an action to launch the wizard, often from a button on another model.
