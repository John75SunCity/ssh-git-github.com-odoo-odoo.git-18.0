        DISABLED: Maintenance Team Views
        
        These view inheritance records are disabled because the parent views
        'maintenance_team_view_form', 'maintenance_team_view_tree', etc. do not
        exist in the standard Odoo maintenance.team model with those external IDs.
        
        The maintenance.team model views use different external IDs in standard Odoo.
        To extend maintenance.team views, we would need to use the correct parent
        view references from the maintenance module.
        
        Example:
        - Use ref="maintenance.view_maintenance_team_form" instead
        - Or create standalone views specific to our records_management module
        
        For now, the additional fields (specialization, naid_certified, etc.)
        are defined in the model and can be accessed through custom views or
        API if needed.
