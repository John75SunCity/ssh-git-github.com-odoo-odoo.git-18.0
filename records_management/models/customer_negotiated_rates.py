"""Tombstone stub.

Legacy model 'customer.negotiated.rates' has been replaced by
the unified singular model 'customer.negotiated.rate'.

This file is intentionally left without any model class so the
validator and Odoo no longer expect security access rules or
database tables for the deprecated plural model.

Do NOT re-introduce a model class here.
