NAID Certificate Management Module

This module provides comprehensive management of NAID (National Association for Information
Destruction) certificates within the Records Management System. It implements certificate
generation, validation, and tracking for secure document destruction and compliance verification.

Key Features:
- Complete NAID certificate lifecycle management from generation to archival
- Automated certificate generation for destruction and compliance events
- Digital signature integration with tamper-proof certificate validation
- Certificate template management with customizable formats and branding
- Compliance verification with NAID AAA standards and requirements
- Integration with destruction services and chain of custody tracking
- Certificate distribution and customer portal access management

Business Processes:
1. Certificate Generation: Automated creation of certificates for destruction events
2. Validation and Verification: Digital signature application and tamper detection
3. Distribution Management: Secure certificate delivery to customers and stakeholders
4. Archive Management: Long-term certificate storage and retrieval systems
5. Compliance Tracking: NAID AAA compliance verification and audit trail maintenance
6. Template Management: Certificate format customization and branding control
7. Audit and Reporting: Certificate tracking and compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

Certificate Types:
- Destruction Certificates: Certificates of secure destruction for document disposal
- Compliance Certificates: NAID AAA compliance verification certificates
- Chain of Custody Certificates: Complete custody trail documentation certificates
- Service Completion Certificates: Service delivery and completion verification
- Annual Compliance Certificates: Periodic compliance and certification renewals
- Special Handling Certificates: Certificates for high-security or sensitive materials

NAID AAA Integration:
- Full compliance with NAID AAA (Audit, Authorization, and Audit) standards
- Integration with NAID member verification and authorization systems
- Automated compliance checking and violation detection with real-time alerts
- Certificate generation following NAID specifications and formatting requirements
- Integration with NAID reporting systems and compliance databases
- Support for NAID audits and certification renewal processes

Security and Validation:
- Digital signature integration with certificate authorities and encryption
- Tamper-proof certificate storage with cryptographic verification
- Certificate authenticity validation and fraud detection systems
- Secure certificate distribution with access control and audit tracking
- Integration with PKI systems and digital certificate management
- Automated certificate expiration monitoring and renewal workflows

Customer Portal Integration:
- Self-service certificate access through customer portal interface
- Real-time certificate status tracking and delivery notifications
- Historical certificate archive with search and retrieval capabilities
- Certificate download and printing with security watermarks
- Integration with customer communication preferences and notifications
- Mobile-responsive design for certificate access from any device

Technical Implementation:
- Modern Odoo 18.0 architecture with comprehensive security frameworks
- Digital signature and cryptographic validation systems
- Performance optimized certificate generation and storage systems
- Integration with external NAID systems and compliance verification services
- Mail thread integration for notifications and activity tracking
