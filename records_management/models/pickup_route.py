Pickup Route Management Module

This module provides comprehensive route planning and optimization for pickup operations within
the Records Management System. It implements intelligent route management, GPS tracking, and
operational efficiency optimization for document collection and service delivery operations.

Key Features:
- Intelligent route planning and optimization with GPS integration
- Multi-stop route management with time and distance optimization
- Driver assignment and vehicle tracking for pickup operations
- Real-time route updates and dynamic rerouting capabilities
- Customer scheduling integration with automated appointment management
- Route performance analytics and efficiency reporting
- Integration with fuel management and cost tracking systems

Business Processes:
1. Route Planning: Automated route creation based on pickup requests and geographical optimization
2. Driver Assignment: Driver allocation based on availability, skills, and route requirements
3. Schedule Management: Customer appointment scheduling and confirmation workflows
4. Route Execution: Real-time tracking and status updates during route execution
5. Performance Analysis: Route efficiency analysis and optimization recommendations
6. Exception Handling: Management of route deviations, delays, and emergency situations
7. Cost Tracking: Fuel, mileage, and operational cost tracking for route profitability

Route Types:
- Regular Routes: Scheduled recurring routes for established customers
- On-Demand Routes: Dynamic routes created for urgent or special requests
- Bulk Routes: High-capacity routes for large-scale document collection operations
- Express Routes: Priority routes for time-sensitive pickups and deliveries
- Maintenance Routes: Specialized routes for equipment delivery and service
- Emergency Routes: Critical routes for security incidents or urgent compliance needs

Optimization Features:
- GPS-based route optimization with real-time traffic integration
- Multi-objective optimization considering time, distance, fuel, and customer priorities
- Dynamic rerouting based on traffic conditions and operational changes
- Load optimization to maximize vehicle capacity and efficiency
- Time window management for customer availability and operational constraints
- Integration with mapping services and traffic monitoring systems

Driver and Vehicle Management:
- Driver assignment based on route complexity and authorization requirements
- Vehicle selection based on capacity, security features, and route requirements
- Driver performance tracking and efficiency metrics
- Vehicle maintenance scheduling and route impact assessment
- Security clearance verification for high-security routes
- Integration with fleet management and telematics systems

Customer Integration:
- Automated customer notifications for pickup schedules and confirmations
- Real-time tracking visibility for customers through portal integration
- Flexible scheduling with customer preference management
- Service level agreement monitoring and compliance verification
- Customer feedback collection and service quality improvement
- Integration with customer portal and communication systems

Technical Implementation:
- Modern Odoo 18.0 architecture with comprehensive GPS and mapping integration
- Real-time route tracking with performance optimization algorithms
- Integration with external mapping services and traffic monitoring systems
- Mobile application support for driver route execution and status updates
- Mail thread integration for notifications and activity tracking
