Records Container Movement Tracking Module

This module provides comprehensive tracking and management of container movements within the
Records Management System. It implements complete movement audit trails, location tracking,
and transfer workflows for containers throughout their lifecycle in the storage facility.

Key Features:
- Complete container movement tracking with GPS and timestamp logging
- Chain of custody maintenance for container transfers between locations
- Movement reason tracking and categorization for audit compliance
- Real-time location updates with barcode scanning integration
- Movement authorization and approval workflows for security compliance
- Integration with inventory management and location tracking systems
- Automated movement notifications and alerts for stakeholders

Business Processes:
1. Movement Initiation: Starting container movement with authorization and reason documentation
2. Transit Tracking: Real-time tracking during container transport and relocation
3. Location Updates: Automatic location updates when containers arrive at destinations
4. Transfer Verification: Multi-party verification for high-security container movements
5. Movement Completion: Final movement confirmation and audit trail closure
6. Exception Handling: Management of delayed, lost, or unauthorized movements
7. Audit Trail Maintenance: Complete movement history and compliance documentation

Movement Types:
- Inbound Movements: Containers entering the facility from customer locations
- Internal Movements: Container relocations within the storage facility
- Outbound Movements: Container removal for destruction, retrieval, or return
- Maintenance Movements: Temporary movements for container inspection or repair
- Emergency Movements: Priority movements for compliance or security reasons
- Bulk Movements: Large-scale container relocations during facility reorganization

Location Integration:
- Real-time integration with storage location management systems
- GPS tracking for mobile containers and transit operations
- Barcode and QR code scanning for accurate location updates
- Integration with facility layout and capacity management
- Automated location availability checking and optimization
- Movement route planning and optimization for operational efficiency

Security and Compliance:
- Movement authorization based on user roles and security clearance
- Chain of custody tracking for NAID AAA compliance requirements
- Movement audit trails with tamper-proof logging and verification
- Integration with security camera systems for visual movement verification
- Unauthorized movement detection and automated alert systems
- Compliance reporting for regulatory and certification requirements

Technical Implementation:
- Modern Odoo 18.0 architecture with mail thread integration
- Real-time GPS tracking and location services integration
- Performance optimized for high-volume movement operations
- Integration with barcode scanning and mobile data collection systems
- Comprehensive audit logging with encryption and security controls
