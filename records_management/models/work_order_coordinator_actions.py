# (Safe to delete in a future cleanup once ensured no references import this explicitly.)
# NOTE: This module intentionally contains no model class. The stray indented
# code was removed to avoid syntax errors. Kept as a placeholder to prevent
# import failures if referenced elsewhere. Remove after confirming no imports.
