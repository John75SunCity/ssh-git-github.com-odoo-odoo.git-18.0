"""Legacy model removed: file.retrieval

This tombstone file intentionally left without an ORM model definition to prevent
reintroduction of deprecated legacy retrieval models. Unified model in use:
`records.retrieval.order` and related line model.

Validator should ignore absence of _name here.

# No model definition on purpose.
