# Key Restriction System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive key restriction system that allows certain customers to be blocked from receiving bin keys, requiring the bin unlock service instead.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Customer-Level Key Restrictions (`res_partner_key_restriction.py`)

- **Field**: `key_issuance_allowed` (Boolean, default True)
- **Restriction Reasons**: Policy, Security, Compliance, Contract, Risk, Other
- **Tracking**: Restriction date, approved by user, detailed notes
- **Status**: Computed field showing "allowed" or "restricted"
- **Validation**: Requires reason when restricting keys

### 2. Enhanced Bin Unlock Service (`bin_unlock_service.py`)

- **New Reason Code**: `key_restriction` added to unlock reasons
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically sets reason when customer is key-restricted
- **Related Fields**: Shows customer restriction status and reason
- **Validation**: Ensures consistency between customer status and unlock reason
- **Helper Method**: `create_for_key_restricted_customer()` for easy service creation

### 3. Key Restriction Management Wizard

- **Restrict Keys**: Wizard to restrict key issuance with reason and notes
- **Allow Keys**: Wizard to remove restrictions with documentation
- **Approval Tracking**: Records who approved restrictions/changes
- **Audit Trail**: Full message logging of all changes

### 4. Technician Key Restriction Checker (`key_restriction_checker.py`)

- **Quick Lookup**: Fast customer name/ID search
- **Visual Status**: Clear allowed/restricted indicators with color coding
- **Instructions**: Specific guidance for technicians
- **Service Creation**: Direct creation of unlock service for restricted customers
- **Safety**: Prevents accidental key issuance

## User Interface Enhancements

### 1. Customer Form Enhancements

- **Warning Banner**: Prominent warning when customer is key-restricted
- **Key Restrictions Tab**: Dedicated tab for restriction management
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators in list and form views
- **Action Buttons**: Quick restrict/allow buttons in button box
- **Statistics**: Count of unlock services due to restrictions

### 2. Bin Unlock Service Enhancements

- **Restriction Warning**: Alert when customer is key-restricted
- **Reason Codes**: Dropdown with key_restriction option
- **Auto-Population**: Automatically sets correct reason for restricted customers
- **Search Filters**: Filter by key restriction services

### 3. Technician Tools

- **Key Checker Widget**: Quick access tool from main menu
- **Real-time Status**: Immediate restriction status checking
- **Service Integration**: Direct creation of unlock services
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for field use

## Security and Access Control

- **Manager-Only Restrictions**: Only records managers can set/remove restrictions
- **User Visibility**: All users can see restriction status
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of restriction changes
- **Validation Rules**: Prevents inconsistent data

## Business Logic Flow

### For Allowed Customers

1. Technician checks customer → Status shows "ALLOWED"
2. Technician can issue keys normally
3. Standard key handling procedures apply

### For Restricted Customers

1. Technician checks customer → Status shows "RESTRICTED" with reason
2. System shows clear "DO NOT ISSUE KEYS" warning
3. Technician creates bin unlock service instead
4. Service automatically tagged with key restriction reason

## Menu Structure

- **Main Menu**: Key Checker (quick access)
- **Tools Menu**: Key Restriction Checker (detailed)
- **Customer Form**: Direct access to restriction management
- **Services Menu**: Filtered views for key restriction services

## Data Integrity

- **Automatic Validation**: Ensures unlock services match customer restrictions
- **Constraint Checking**: Prevents invalid restriction configurations
- **Related Field Updates**: Real-time status synchronization
- **Migration Safe**: Existing customers default to "allowed"

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Errors**: Impossible to accidentally issue keys to restricted customers
2. **Clear Communication**: Visual warnings and instructions for staff
3. **Audit Compliance**: Complete tracking of restriction decisions
4. **Service Automation**: Streamlined unlock service creation
5. **Flexible Policy**: Supports various restriction reasons and scenarios

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Security Customer

- Customer requires no keys due to security policy
- Restriction set with "Security Requirements" reason
- All access requires supervised unlock service
- Full audit trail maintained

### Scenario 2: Compliance Requirement

- Customer's compliance rules prohibit key possession
- Restriction set with "Compliance Requirements" reason
- Bin unlock service provides controlled access
- Documentation automatically generated

### Scenario 3: Risk Management

- Customer has history of lost keys
- Restriction set with "Risk Assessment" reason
- Service-only access reduces risk exposure
- Statistical tracking of service needs

This implementation provides a comprehensive solution that protects against accidental key issuance while maintaining efficient service delivery for restricted customers.
