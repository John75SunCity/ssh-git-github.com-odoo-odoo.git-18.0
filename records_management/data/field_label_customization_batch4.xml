    <!--
        Placeholder legacy file intentionally retained to satisfy non-deterministic
        validator cache lookups referencing this historical path.

        Real data file in use:
            data/field_label_customization_batch_data.xml

        Rationale:
        - Historical validator still probes for this filename intermittently.
        - Keeping an empty wellâ€‘formed XML document prevents false XML syntax errors.
        - No <record> elements to avoid duplicate external IDs.

        If validator stabilizes (no further lookups), this file may be safely removed.
