## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Model Inheritance Structure

```python
# All models inherit from mail.thread for tracking
class BinKeyManagement(models.Model):
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']
    
class BinUnlockService(models.Model):
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']
```

### Computed Field Examples

```python
# Partner model extensions
has_bin_key = fields.Boolean(compute='_compute_bin_key_status')
active_bin_key_count = fields.Integer(compute='_compute_bin_key_counts')
total_unlock_charges = fields.Float(compute='_compute_unlock_totals')
```

### Action Method Patterns

```python
# Standard action methods for key operations
def action_issue_new_key(self)
def action_return_key(self)
def action_report_lost_key(self)
def action_view_bin_keys(self)
```
