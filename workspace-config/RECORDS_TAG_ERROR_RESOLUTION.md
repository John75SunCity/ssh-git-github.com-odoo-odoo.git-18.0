# Records.Tag View Error Resolution - Build 18.0.2.49.93

## Issue Diagnosed
The persistent error `ValueError: Wrong value for ir.ui.view.type: 'tree'` was occurring because Odoo 18.0 has completely removed explicit view type specifications. The system was trying to create views with explicit `type='tree'` which is no longer valid.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Complete View Reconstruction
- **Replaced ALL view IDs** with completely new identifiers to eliminate caching issues:
  - `records_tag_view_tree` ‚Üí `view_records_tag_tree_new`
  - `records_tag_view_form` ‚Üí `view_records_tag_form_new`
  - `records_tag_view_search` ‚Üí `view_records_tag_search_new`
  - `action_records_tag` ‚Üí `action_records_tag_new`

### 2. Odoo 18.0 Native Approach
- **Removed ALL explicit attributes** that could trigger type inference issues
- **Simplified view structure** to minimal requirements
- **Let Odoo auto-infer** view types from XML elements (`<tree>`, `<form>`, `<search>`)

### 3. View Definitions (Minimal & Clean)

#### Tree View
```xml
<tree editable="bottom" sample="1">
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="color" widget="color"/>
    <field name="description" optional="show"/>
</tree>
```

#### Form View  
```xml
<form>
    <sheet>
        <div class="oe_title">
            <h1><field name="name" placeholder="Tag Name..."/></h1>
        </div>
        <group>
            <field name="color" widget="color"/>
            <field name="active"/>
        </group>
        <group>
            <field name="description" nolabel="1" placeholder="Describe what this tag represents..."/>
        </group>
    </sheet>
</form>
```

#### Search View
```xml
<search>
    <field name="name"/>
    <field name="description"/>
    <filter string="Active" name="active" domain="[('active', '=', True)]"/>
    <filter string="Archived" name="inactive" domain="[('active', '=', False)]"/>
</search>
```

### 4. Updated References
- **Menu action updated** to use `action_records_tag_new`
- **Model includes `toggle_active` method** for archive/unarchive functionality
- **Version bumped** to `18.0.2.49.93` to force clean deployment

## Key Changes for Odoo 18.0 Compatibility

### What Was Removed
- ‚ùå All explicit `string` attributes on views
- ‚ùå All explicit `required="1"` attributes  
- ‚ùå Complex group structures in search views
- ‚ùå Explicit `string` attributes on tree/form elements
- ‚ùå Any potential type-triggering attributes

### What Was Simplified
- ‚úÖ Minimal XML structure with only essential elements
- ‚úÖ Auto-inferred field requirements from model definition
- ‚úÖ Clean, modern Odoo 18.0 native approach
- ‚úÖ Completely new IDs to eliminate database cache issues

## Expected Outcome
This complete reconstruction should resolve the `ir.ui.view.type: 'tree'` error by:
1. **Eliminating legacy view definitions** that might have cached type specifications
2. **Using pure Odoo 18.0 standards** with auto-inference
3. **Fresh view IDs** prevent any database conflicts
4. **Minimal structure** reduces possibility of compatibility issues

## Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ **Committed**: Build 18.0.2.49.93
- ‚úÖ **Pushed**: Successfully pushed to working branch
- üîÑ **Auto-Sync**: Will trigger main branch deployment via GitHub Actions
- üìä **Monitor**: Watch for yellow build status on Odoo.sh

---
**Next Step**: Monitor deployment logs to confirm the `records.tag` error is resolved with the completely rebuilt views.
