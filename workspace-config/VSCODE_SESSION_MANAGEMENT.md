# VS Code Session Management - Successfully Configured

## Overview
Complete setup implemented to prevent VS Code timeouts during long development sessions.

## Configuration Summary

### 1. VS Code Workspace Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`)
✅ **Status: ACTIVE**
- SSH connection timeouts extended (300s)
- Keep-alive enabled with 30s intervals
- Auto-save configured (1s delay)
- Terminal scrollback increased (50,000 lines)
- Git auto-fetch enabled
- Telemetry disabled to reduce network calls

### 2. Session Maintenance Script (`keep_session_alive.sh`)
✅ **Status: RUNNING** (PID: 23824)
- Automatic activity simulation every 5 minutes
- Background process keeps VS Code connection active
- Logs session activity for monitoring

### 3. Bash Environment (`.bashrc`)
✅ **Status: CONFIGURED**
- Environment variable: `VSCODE_KEEPALIVE=true`
- Alias created: `keep-alive` command
- Settings automatically loaded on shell startup

## Usage Commands

### Start Session Maintenance
```bash
keep-alive           # Start background session maintenance
```

### Monitor Session Status
```bash
ps aux | grep keep_session    # Check if script is running
tail -f session_activity.log  # Monitor activity logs
```

### Manual Session Activity
```bash
./keep_session_alive.sh       # Run session maintenance manually
```

## Implementation Details

### Timeout Prevention Methods
1. **Connection Keep-Alive**: SSH server alive intervals (30s)
2. **Activity Simulation**: Periodic workspace touches
3. **Auto-Save**: Prevents work loss during timeouts
4. **Background Maintenance**: Continuous session activity

### Files Modified/Created
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace configuration
- `keep_session_alive.sh` - Session maintenance script
- `/home/vscode/.bashrc` - Bash environment settings
- `session_activity.log` - Activity monitoring (auto-created)

## Verification
- ✅ VS Code settings loaded and active
- ✅ Session script running in background (PID: 23824)
- ✅ Bash alias configured and working
- ✅ Auto-save enabled (1 second delay)
- ✅ Extended terminal scrollback active

## Next Steps
The VS Code environment is now configured for extended development sessions. You can:
1. Continue working on the Records Management module
2. Monitor session logs if needed
3. Use `keep-alive` command to restart if needed
