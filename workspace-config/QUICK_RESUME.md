✅ View inheritance selector errors and invalid group_by contexts
✅ QWeb field reference errors in template rendering
✅ Customer inventory view validation and indentation errors
✅ Related field KeyError issues converted to computed fields

✅ XML domain validation error in department form view (partner_id reference)
✅ Customer inventory kanban view warnings (kanban-box → card, FontAwesome titles)

## Current Module Features:
- Complete multi-level department hierarchy (Company → Department → Sub-Department → Users)
- 4-tier customer portal access system (viewer/user/dept_admin/company_admin)
- Enhanced user management with invitation system and email notifications
- Comprehensive billing integration with contacts and automated invoice generation
- Modern Odoo 18.0 compliant views and XML structure

## Last Actions Completed:
1. Fixed XML ParseError in departmental_billing_views.xml (removed problematic domain)
2. Updated customer inventory kanban view for Odoo 18 compliance
3. Added accessibility titles to all FontAwesome icons (WCAG compliance)
4. Replaced deprecated 'kanban-box' template with modern 'card' template

## Next Expected Issues:
- Possible additional view validation warnings

**Status**: Ready for next error iteration - deployment should be significantly more stable.
