# Quick Session Recovery Guide

## For AI Assistant - COPY/PASTE THIS INTO NEW SESSION:

```
I have an Odoo 18.0 Records Management module with systematic field reference issues. 

We've already fixed:
✅ Duplicate res.partner.department.billing models  
✅ Field reference mismatches (company_id → partner_id)
✅ Security rule domain corrections
✅ Portal controller search queries

Current status: department_ids One2many field commented out due to KeyError.

Please review /workspaces/ssh-git-github.com-odoo-odoo.git-18.0/workspace-config/DEBUGGING_SESSION_SUMMARY.md for full context.

Ready to continue debugging next RPC_ERROR with preserved progress.
```

## For Human - Quick Resume:
1. ☑️ All previous fixes are committed and deployed
2. ☑️ Systematic field audit completed  
3. ☑️ 4 major errors resolved
4. ⏭️ Ready for next error iteration

**Next Action**: Deploy and paste any new RPC_ERROR message.
