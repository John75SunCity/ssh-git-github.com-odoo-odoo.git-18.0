"""
Departmental Billing Demo for Records Management System

This script demonstrates the advanced departmental billing capabilities:
1. Consolidated billing - One invoice with department breakdown (45 departments, 1 invoice)
2. Separate billing - Individual invoices per department (45 departments, 45 invoices)  
3. Hybrid billing - Consolidated storage, separate services
4. Department-level billing contacts and PO numbers
5. Minimum fee handling (per department vs company-wide)

Usage:
    python3 departmental_billing_demo.py
    
This script creates test data and demonstrates billing scenarios for large companies
with many departments.
