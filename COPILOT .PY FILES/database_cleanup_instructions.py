ODOO MODULE INSTALLATION TROUBLESHOOTING

The error suggests that Odoo is still trying to load old view definitions that reference 
non-existent fields. This typically happens due to database caching.

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:

1. **Database Reset (Recommended)**:
   - Drop and recreate the database completely
   - This ensures no old cached view definitions interfere

2. **Module Uninstall/Reinstall**:
   - Uninstall the records_management module completely
   - Clear module data: DELETE FROM ir_model_data WHERE module = 'records_management';
   - Reinstall the module

3. **View Conflict Resolution**:
   - Check for duplicate view external IDs in the database
   - Remove old view definitions manually

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ All XML files are syntactically valid
✅ No duplicate view definitions found in XML files  
✅ All field references match their respective models
✅ The problematic 'code' field references have been removed

The error persisting suggests database-level caching of old view definitions.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Reset the database completely 
2. Install the module fresh
3. If that fails, check for any remaining view definition conflicts in the database
