# Menu Structure (Placeholder)

This placeholder file is reserved for future automated generation of the Odoo menu/action hierarchy.

Planned content outline:
- Top-Level Menus
- Submenus with XML IDs
- Window Actions (name → model → view modes)
- Wizards / Reports entries
- Security group restrictions (if derivable)

Generation not yet implemented in `scripts/update_handbook.py`.
