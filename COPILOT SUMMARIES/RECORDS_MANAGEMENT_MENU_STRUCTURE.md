- **Security Groups**: Appropriate group restrictions for different user levels
- **Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationships following Odoo standards
- **Naming**: Descriptive menu names following business terminology

### ✅ User Experience
- **Logical Grouping**: Related functions are grouped together
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic operations first, advanced configuration last
- **Role-Based Access**: Different menu visibility based on user permissions
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear section separation with visual indicators

### ✅ Security Structure
- **Regular Users** (`group_records_user`): Access to Operations, Inventory, and Reporting
- **Managers** (`group_records_manager`): Additional access to Configuration and administrative functions

### ✅ Removed Duplicates
Cleaned up duplicate menu definitions that existed in multiple files:
- Removed duplicate root menu from `stock_lot_views.xml`
- Removed duplicate customer inventory menu from `customer_inventory_views.xml`
- Removed duplicate retention policy menu from `records_retention_policy_views.xml`
- Removed duplicate document type menu from `records_document_type_views.xml`
- Removed duplicate pickup request menu from `pickup_request.xml`

## Compatibility Notes

### Standard Odoo Patterns
The menu structure follows standard Odoo application patterns:
- Operations → Daily work activities
- Inventory/Management → Data management and tracking
- Reporting → Analytics and insights
- Configuration → Administrative setup

### External Dependencies
- **Product Management**: Leverages standard Odoo product actions
- **Stock Management**: Integrates with Odoo inventory system
- **Security**: Uses Odoo's group-based permission system

This structure provides a solid foundation for Records Management operations while maintaining full compatibility with Odoo 18.0 and Odoo.sh deployment requirements.
