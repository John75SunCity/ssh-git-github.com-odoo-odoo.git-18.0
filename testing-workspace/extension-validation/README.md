# Extension-Based Validation Approach

## Strategy: Use Odoo Extensions as Intelligent Validators

Instead of writing new code, we'll paste existing problematic code and let the extensions suggest corrections.

## Process

1. **Copy problematic code** to test files here
2. **Let extensions analyze** and highlight issues
3. **Compare suggestions** with current implementation  
4. **Document findings** for application to main codebase
5. **Apply fixes** only to main development files after validation

## Current Focus: Data File Field Validation

Testing the `location_type` field error from model_records.xml

## Extensions Active

- Odoo IDE (trinhanhngoc.vscode-odoo)
- Odoo Development (scapigliato.vsc-odoo-development)  
- Odoo Snippets (jigar-patel.odoosnippets)
