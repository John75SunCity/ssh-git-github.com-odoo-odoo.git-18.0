# Testing Workspace

This directory is completely separate from the active development environment.

## Purpose

- Test Odoo extension-based validation approach
- Experimental code analysis
- Field validation testing
- Data file problem detection

## Structure

- `extension-validation/` - Using Odoo extensions to validate code
- `data-analysis/` - Data file testing and validation
- `field-testing/` - Model field validation experiments

## Rules

- NEVER modify active development files from here
- All changes go through proper validation before applying to main codebase
- This workspace is for analysis and testing only
