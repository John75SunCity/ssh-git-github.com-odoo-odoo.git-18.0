## 🎯 **Extension-Enhanced Features**

### **Professional Pattern Recognition**
```python
# AI now automatically suggests:
class RecordsModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'records.model'
    _inherit = ['mail.thread', 'mail.activity.mixin']  # Extension pack pattern
    _description = 'Model Description'  # Training standard
    _order = 'name'  # Professional ordering
    _rec_name = 'name'  # Extension best practice
    
    # Core fields with professional patterns
    name = fields.Char(required=True, tracking=True, index=True)
    company_id = fields.Many2one('res.company', default=lambda self: self.env.company)
    # ... Extension pack generates complete professional structure
```

### **Advanced IntelliSense Integration**
```python
# When typing, AI suggests:
✅ Professional field types with proper constraints
✅ Training-validated method signatures  
✅ Extension pack recommended decorators
✅ Complete relationship definitions
✅ Performance-optimized compute methods
```

### **Workflow Integration**
```python
# AI understands complex workflows:
def action_confirm_pickup(self):
    """AI generates with extension context understanding:
    - State management patterns
    - Professional error handling
    - Training audit requirements  
    - Extension pack security validations
    """
    self.ensure_one()  # Professional pattern
    self._validate_business_rules()  # Training standard
    self._create_naid_audit_log()  # Records Management context
    self.write({'state': 'confirmed'})  # Extension best practice
```
