# NAID AAA Compliance Implementation Summary

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Many2many Field Conflict Resolution ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The shredding.service model had two Many2many fields (`bin_ids` and `shredded_box_ids`) both pointing to `stock.lot` without explicit relation table specifications, causing Odoo to auto-generate identical table names and resulting in database conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- `bin_ids` now uses custom relation: `'shredding_bin_rel'`
- `shredded_box_ids` now uses custom relation: `'shredding_box_rel'`
- This prevents the TypeError during module installation/upgrade in Odoo.sh

### 2. Model Registry Safety Checks ‚úÖ
**Enhancement**: Added safe model registry checks (`self.env.registry.get('model.name')`) before attempting to create records in dependent models, preventing errors if NAID models aren't fully loaded yet.
